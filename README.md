## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Resume Not Parsing Correctly

**Issue:** AI parsing failed or extracted wrong information

**Solutions:**
1. Try uploading a different file format (PDF → DOCX or vice versa)
2. If resume is scanned/image-based, wait for OCR (may take 30+ seconds)
3. Use manual entry to correct any errors
4. Check console for errors (F12 → Console tab)

### "Profile is Empty" Error

**Issue:** Can't proceed to job analysis

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure you've uploaded a resume OR used manual entry
2. Click "Confirm & Continue" on review page to save profile
3. Add at least name, email, and experience/skills
4. Check that profile fields aren't blank

### DOCX Download Not Working

**Issue:** Error when trying to download documents

**Solutions:**
1. Refresh the page and try again
2. Try "Copy Text" button instead and paste into Word
3. Ensure popup blocker isn't preventing download
4. Check browser console for errors

### Job Analysis Shows Low Match

**Issue:** Match score lower than expected

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure your resume has relevant experience and skills
2. Check that you pasted the FULL job description

5. Address gaps in the gap explanation field

### OCR Taking Too Long

**Issue:** Scanned PDF processing is slow

**Solutions:**
1. Wait patiently (can take 30-60 seconds for multi-page PDFs)

3. Use DOCX format instead if possible
4. Reduce file size (fewer pages)

### Lost My Profile Data

**Issue:** Profile disappeared after closing browser

**Solutions:**
1. Check if you're in Incognito/Private mode (data doesn't persist)
